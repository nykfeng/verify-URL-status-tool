# Brand/business URL Verification Tools

## Links

- [Deployed Application]()

## Description
### Brands and businesses come and go and evolve over time, and their URLs could change, become inactive or redirect to a new landing page. When you have a database of many brands and their information, some of those URLs could be outdated already. This tool serves the purpose of checking up on these URLS. A URL change for a business could mean the business underwent corporate change or simply went out of business. This tool will run through these business URLs and find out which are the ones that need updates or are no longer relevant.
